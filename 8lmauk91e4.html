This is in-line with both reviewers' suggestion of using the t-test. Minor tweaks from the original proposal (including the whole year instead of just the month of January) was also added so th . Specifically, we looked at Welch's t-test which does not assume equal population variance.&nbsp; On python, we used the scipy&nbsp;package to run a one-tailed t-test.&nbsp; For our one-tailed t-test, if the t-statistic is positive and the p-value divided by two is less than&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\alpha\)</span>, we can reject the null hypothesis.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Other possible tests for our hypothesis that we can conduct:</div><div></div><ol><li>Two sample Z-test</li></ol><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
