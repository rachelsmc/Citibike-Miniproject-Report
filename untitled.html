<div><b>Abstract&nbsp;</b></div><div>summary of idea and result</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction</b>&nbsp;</div><div>CitiBike is a privately owned bicycle sharing system that serves New York City, Jersey City and New Jersey. It officially opened in 2013 and serves to provide an alternative transportation choice for a city plagued with transportation woes.&nbsp; We would like to investigate if there is a difference in trip duration on the Citibike between Males and Females which may give insights on usage patterns due to possible gender factors that may help Citibike improve its system and increase usage of its bike in terms of total trip duration. Some factors that contribute to gender difference includes differences in attire (hence affecting trip duration usage).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>H<sub>0</sub>: Trip duration of females on average is equal or higher than trip duration of males on average in  2016&nbsp;</div><div>H<sub>1</sub>: Trip duration of females on average is lower than trip duration of males on average in 2016&nbsp;</div><div>Significance level: 0.05</div><div>   </div><div><b>Data</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Data was extracted from the official Citibikes System Data retrievable at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data</a>.
