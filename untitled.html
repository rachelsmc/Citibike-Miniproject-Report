<div><b>Abstract&nbsp;</b></div><div>Citibike, a bike sharing system, was introduced into several parts of New York City in 2013 and have since been available in many areas around with its iconic blue bicycles.</div><div>Various city dwellers use it, varying from age of users to gender of users. These data are captured in the Citibikes System Data retrievable online.&nbsp; The team set out to investigate if the average trip duration of female bikers is longer than or equals to the average trip duration of males on average in 2016. The one-tailed t-test was used to compare the means of the two samples.</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction</b>&nbsp;</div><div>CitiBike is a privately owned bicycle sharing system that serves New York City, Jersey City and New Jersey. It officially opened in 2013 and serves to provide an alternative transportation choice for a city plagued with transportation woes.&nbsp; We would like to investigate if there is a difference in trip duration on the Citibike between Males and Females which may give insights on usage patterns due to possible gender factors that may help Citibike improve its system and increase usage of its bike in terms of total trip duration. Some factors that contribute to gender difference includes differences in attire (hence affecting trip duration usage).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>H<sub>0</sub>: Average trip duration of females is longer than or equal to average trip duration of males&nbsp;</div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Trip\ Duration_F\ -\ Trip\ Duration_M\ \ge\ 0\)</span></div><div>H<sub>1</sub>: Average trip duration of females is shorter than average trip duration of males&nbsp;</div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Trip\ Duration_F-Trip\ Duration_M\ &lt;0\)</span></div><div>   Significance level: 0.05</div><div></div><div><b>Data</b></div><div>Data was extracted from the official Citibikes System Data retrievable at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data</a>.&nbsp; The data set for 2016 is available in four different quarters (Jan-Mar; Apr-Jun;Jul-Sep;Oct-Dec). The headings for the month of October were logged in differently from the rest of the months and we renamed the columns for consistency. We then concatenated the four different&nbsp; quarters into a single data frame.&nbsp; Data was then separated by gender (Male == 1 and Female == 2) to run the analysis.</div><div></div>
