<div><b>Abstract&nbsp;</b></div><div>Citibike, a bike sharing system, was introduced into several parts of New York City in 2013 and have since been available in many areas around with its iconic blue bicycles.</div><div>Various city dwellers use it, varying from age of users to gender of users. These data are captured in the Citibikes System Data retrievable online.&nbsp; The team set out to investigate if the trip duration of female bikers on average is equal or higher than the trip duration of males on average in 2016. The t-test was used to compare the means of the two samples.</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction</b>&nbsp;</div><div>CitiBike is a privately owned bicycle sharing system that serves New York City, Jersey City and New Jersey. It officially opened in 2013 and serves to provide an alternative transportation choice for a city plagued with transportation woes.&nbsp; We would like to investigate if there is a difference in trip duration on the Citibike between Males and Females which may give insights on usage patterns due to possible gender factors that may help Citibike improve its system and increase usage of its bike in terms of total trip duration. Some factors that contribute to gender difference includes differences in attire (hence affecting trip duration usage).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>H<sub>0</sub>: Average trip duration of females is equal to average trip duration of males&nbsp;</div><div>H<sub>1</sub>: Average trip duration of females is not equal to average trip duration of males&nbsp;</div><div>Significance level: 0.05</div><div>   </div><div><b>Data</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Data was extracted from the official Citibikes System Data retrievable at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data</a>.&nbsp; The data set is available in four different quarters (Jan-Mar; Apr-Jun;</div><div>(   &nbsp;<a href="http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rreHM/6/" target="_blank">Jan - Mar</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8eZnB/2/" target="_blank">Apr - Jun</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xXpEp/18/" target="_blank">Jul - Sep</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gRmSF/13/">Oct - Dec</a>&nbsp;)</div><div>   Rename oct 2016&nbsp;.

This should include figures (with captions!!) that help visualize and understand the data.</i></div><div></div><div><b>Methodology</b></div><div>The test we chose to use is the t-test because we are comparing the means of&nbsp;two samples of different sizes - trip duration of females and trip duration of males. Specifically, we looked at Welch's t-test which does not assume equal population variance.&nbsp; scipy t test</div><div>Other possible tests can include either the (1) Two sample Z-test as well as the (2) ANOVA test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The two sample Z test is a good test for comparing two means as well . Although the ANOVA is not a test for comparison of means, it will work for two or more independent variables which we have in this case.&nbsp;</div><div>      &nbsp;</div><div><b>Conclusions&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div>The P-value&nbsp;</div><div><i>The result and its significance, including the weaknesses and strengths of the analysis.
