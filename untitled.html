It officially opened in 2013 and serves to provide an alternative transportation choice for a city plagued with transportation woes.&nbsp; We would like to investigate if there is a difference in trip duration on the Citibike between Males and Females which may give insights on usage patterns due to possible gender factors that may help Citibike improve its system and increase usage of its bike in terms of total trip duration. Some factors that contribute to gender difference includes differences in attire (hence affecting trip duration usage).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>H<sub>0</sub>: Average trip duration of females is longer than or equal to average trip duration of males&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Trip\ Duration_F\ -\ Trip\ Duration_M\ \ge\ 0\)</span></div><div>H<sub>1</sub>: Average trip duration of females is shorter than average trip duration of males&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Trip\ Duration_F-Trip\ Duration_M\ &lt;0\)</span></div><div>   Significance level: 0.05</div>
