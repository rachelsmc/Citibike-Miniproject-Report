The headings for the month of October were logged in differently from the rest of the months and we renamed the columns for consistency.

This should include figures (with captions!!) that help visualize and understand the data.</i></div><div></div><div><b>Methodology</b></div><div>The test we chose to use is the one-tailed t-test because we are comparing the means of&nbsp;two samples of different sizes - trip duration of females and trip duration of males. Specifically, we looked at Welch's t-test which does not assume equal population variance.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>scipy t test</div><div>Other possible tests can include either the (1) Two sample Z-test as well as the (2) ANOVA test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The two sample Z test is a good test for comparing two means as well . Although the ANOVA is not a test for comparison of means, it will work for two or more independent variables which we have in this case.&nbsp;</div><div>      &nbsp;</div><div><b>Conclusions&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div>The P-value&nbsp;</div><div><i>The result and its significance, including the weaknesses and strengths of the analysis.
