<div><b>Data</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Data was extracted from the official Citibikes System Data retrievable at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data</a>.&nbsp; The data set for 2016 is available in four different quarters (Jan-Mar; Apr-Jun;Jul-Sep;Oct-Dec). The headings for the month of October were logged in differently from the rest of the months and we renamed the columns for consistency. We then concatenated the four different&nbsp; quarters into a single data frame.&nbsp; Data was then separated by gender (Male == 1 and Female == 2) to run the analysis.</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;Figure:&nbsp;</div><div><i>a description of the data you use and how it is processed. This should include figures (with captions!!) that help visualize and understand the data.</i></div><div></div><div><b>Methodology</b></div><div>The test we chose to use is the one-tailed t-test because we are comparing the means of&nbsp;two samples of different sizes - trip duration of females and trip duration of males. Specifically, we looked at Welch's t-test which does not assume equal population variance.&nbsp; On python, we used the scipy&nbsp;package to run a one-tailed t-test.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Other possible tests we can conduct:</div><ol><li>Two sample Z-test</li><li>ANOVA test.</li></ol><div>The two sample Z test is a good test for comparing two means as well . The ANOVA test can be used to test the statistical difference between two or more means, so it can also be applied to our hypothesis.&nbsp;</div><div>      &nbsp;</div><div><b>Conclusions&nbsp;</b></div><div>The P-value&nbsp;</div><div><i>The result and its significance, including the weaknesses and strengths of the analysis. Either this session of the previous one should contain figures as well to show the results.</i></div><div><i>Each session has to be included, each has to be written in plain English, full sentences. Each session should be between 50 and 100 words.</i></div><div></div><div>Other possible tests can include either the (1) Two sample Z-test as well as the (2) ANOVA test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The two sample Z test is a good test for comparing two means as well . The ANOVA&nbsp; will work for two or more independent variables which we have in this case.&nbsp;</div><div>      &nbsp;</div><div></div>
