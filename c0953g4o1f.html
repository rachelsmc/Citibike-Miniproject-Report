<div><b>The ANOVA test can be used to test the statistical difference between two or more means, so it can also be applied to our hypothesis.&nbsp;   &nbsp;</b></div><div>Data was extracted from the official Citibikes System Data retrievable at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data</a>.&nbsp; The data set for 2016 is available in four different quarters (Jan-Mar; Apr-Jun;Jul-Sep;Oct-Dec). The headings for the month of October were logged in differently from the rest of the months and we renamed the columns for consistency.
